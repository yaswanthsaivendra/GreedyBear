# Contribute

## Rules
GreedyBear welcomes contributors from anywhere and from any kind of education or skill level. We strive to create a community of developers that is welcoming, friendly and right.

For this reason it is important to follow some easy rules based on a simple but important concept: **Respect**.

* Before starting to work on an issue, you need to get the approval of one of the maintainers. Therefore please ask to be assigned to an issue. If you do not that but you still raise a PR for that issue, your PR can be rejected. This is a form of respect for both the maintainers and the other contributors who could have already started to work on the same problem.

* When you ask to be assigned to an issue, it means that you are ready to work on it. When you get assigned, take the lock and then you disappear, you are not respecting the maintainers and the other contributors who could be able to work on that. So, after having been assigned, you have a week of time to deliver your first *draft* PR. After that time has passed without any notice, you will be unassigned.

* Before asking questions regarding how the project works, please read *through all the documentation* and [install](https://greedybear.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html) the project on your own local machine to try it and understand how it basically works. This is a form of respect to the maintainers.

* Once you started working on an issue and you have some work to share and discuss with us, please raise a draft PR early with incomplete changes. This way you can continue working on the same and we can track your progress and actively review and help. This is a form of respect to you and to the maintainers.

* When creating a PR, please read through the sections that you will find in the PR template and compile it appropriately. If you do not, your PR can be rejected. This is a form of respect to the maintainers.

## Code Style
Keeping to a consistent code style throughout the project makes it easier to contribute and collaborate. We make use of [`psf/black`](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for code formatting and [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org) for style guides.

## How to start (Setup project and development instance)
To start with the development setup, make sure you go through all the steps in [Installation Guide](https://greedybear.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html) and properly installed it.
Please create a new branch based on the **develop** branch that contains the most recent changes. This is mandatory.
`git checkout -b myfeature develop`

Then we strongly suggest to configure [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) to force linters on every commits you perform:
```bash
# create virtualenv to host pre-commit installation
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# from the project base directory
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Please create a new branch based on the **develop** branch that contains the most recent changes. This is mandatory.

Remember that whenever you make changes, you need to rebuild the docker image to see the reflected changes.
## Create a pull request

### Remember!!!
Please create pull requests only for the branch **develop**. That code will be pushed to master only on a new release.

Also remember to pull the most recent changes available in the **develop** branch before submitting your PR. If your PR has merge conflicts caused by this behavior, it won't be accepted.

### Install testing requirements
Run `pip install -r test-requirements.txt` to install the requirements to validate your code.

#### Pass linting and tests
 Run `psf/black` to lint the files automatically, then `flake8` to check and `isort`.

 (if you installed `pre-commit` this is performed automatically at every commit)

  if you get any errors, fix them.
  Once you make sure that everything is working fine, please squash all of our commits into a single one and finally create a pull request.
